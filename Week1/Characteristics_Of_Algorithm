1.Fiteness : An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps and further
each steps must be executable in finite amount of time. 

2. Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the action to be carried
out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case. 

3. Input: An algorithm has zero or more, but only finite number of inputs. 
zero input example: ASCII chart of 0-255 

4. Output: An algorithm has one or more output. 

5. Effectiveness: Should be effective that means each of the operation to be
performed in an algorithm must be sufficiently basic that it can, in principle,
be done exactly and in a finite length of time, by a person using pencil and
paper and should be computer programming language independent

Version 2

Precision – the steps are precisely stated(defined).

Uniqueness – results of each step are uniquely defined and only depend on the input and the result of the preceding steps.

Finiteness – the algorithm stops after a finite number of instructions are executed.
 
Input – the algorithm receives input.

Output – the algorithm produces output.

Generality – the algorithm applies to a set of inputs.
